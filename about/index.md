If you go to the gym and you work out,

and you come back and you look in the mirror, you will see

nothing.

And if you go to the gym the next day

and you come back and you look in the mirror, you will see

nothing.

So clearly there’s no results,

it can’t be measured

it must not be effective.

So we quit.

Or

If you fundamentally believe that this is the right course of action

and stick with it,

you commit yourself to the regime, the exercise,

If you stick with it consistently, I’m not exactly sure what day,

but I know you’ll start getting into shape.

There’s no event.

It’s an accumulation

of lots and lots of little things, that any one by themselves

is innocuous and useless.

But if you do it consistently,

and you do it in combination with lots of other little things,

it’s those little innocuous things that you do

over and over and over and over

that matter the most.
